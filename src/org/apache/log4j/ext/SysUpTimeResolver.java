/**
 * Title: SysUpTimeResolver<br>
 * Description: A class implementing this interface must provide a way of returning the system "up time",
 * in milliseconds. For example, you might have a class the uses a JNI call to an operating system
 * API to determine the real "up time" of the host machine.  You would specify the FQN of your
 * implmenting class in your properties file.  The SNMPTrapAppender includes a default implementation
 * of this interface that simply calls System.currentTimeMillis() to set the time.<br>
